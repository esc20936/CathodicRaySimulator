# Cathodic Ray Tube simulator

We have developed a pc simulator of how would a cathodic ray tube would work in practice given specific values.
The simulator includes 2 modes (sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal). The way the simulator works is by using the following formulas:
1.
$$charge of the electron / mass of the electron$$

This formula will give us the element load ratio.

2.
$$\theta y = (VL)/((vx)^2 *d) (charge of the electron / mass of the electron)$$
